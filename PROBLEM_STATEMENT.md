### **PS02 - Construction Field Management Application**

**Description:-** This is a construction field management application that helps site engineers and managers digitize their daily work by replacing WhatsApp messages, phone calls, and paper registers with a single, mobile-first platform. Participants will design and build features like project and task management, Daily Progress Reports (with photos), GPS-based attendance, material requests and approvals, and GST-ready invoicing tailored for real construction sites in India. The challenge is to create a fast, offline-friendly, easy-to-use solution for field teams working in low-connectivity conditions, while giving owners and managers clear dashboards, reports, and transparency into work, costs, and delays across multiple projects.

**Business Requirements:-**

- Enable digitized and standardized field operations across projects, DPRs, attendance, materials, and invoicing in a single unified system.
- Provide real-time visibility into project progress, workforce utilization, material consumption, and billing through dashboards and reports.
- Ensure seamless coordination between site and office teams via structured workflows for approvals, updates, and communication.
- Reduce labor and material leakages by tightly tracking attendance, daily work, and material requests with proper authorization and history.
- Support on-ground construction conditions with a mobile-first, low-bandwidth, and offline-capable experience for site users.
